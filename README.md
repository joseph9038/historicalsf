# Historical San Francisco

Similar in concept to [this other project](https://github.com/jimmcgaw/historic), but here I am using [GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/gis/) to construct the backend API. GeoDjango actually has some very rich geospatial querying tools built into its GIS ORM models, which make this potentially more promising than clobbering something together from Flask, SQLAlchemy, GeoAlchemy, and Jinja2.
